## Stand up summary
Yesterday, I worked with Mariem and Celeste on their filter events feature to help with implementing removal of a filter. Today, I will work with Jahesh on the saving journal feature by implementing the retrieval of past journal entries. No one should be blocked by my work, but I will follow up on the progress in both these features.

We meet each week for around 40 minutes.
