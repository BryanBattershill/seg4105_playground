### Problems
* I would like to be able to have a live chat with a Teacher.
* I would like to be able to remove finished classes from my list of classes
* I would like to be able to organize the order my classes appear in

### Solutions
* Implement a feature similar to the discussion forum for a live chat. Instead of making posts, you can simply send a message directly to the teacher and vice versa.
* Implement a check for if a course has reached its end for the student. If so, add a button which will hide the class in the class list.
* Implement a reorder tool so the student can pick which order the classes will appear in
