# Shape Up

## Things I like
* 6 week cycles is a nice change from the typical 2 weeks. More time to work on features
* Not tracking hours spent on individual aspects
* Planning focuses on bigger ideas rather than small tasks
* Teams are more autonomous
* Focuses on a complete project at each step, rather than individual components
## Things I don't like
* Might leave a lot to be interpreted from plans, could go a different direction than expected

## Questions
* What is the right balance between small scale planning and bigger picture planning?
* How do teams plan within themselves to complete their 6 week cycle?
