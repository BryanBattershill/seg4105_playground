## Keep doing
* Discussions about bugs and testing has been really good and consistent
* Collaboration on features has been increasing and speeding up development
* Offering ideas and questions about features to make them the best possible

## Stop doing
* Keep weekly meetings to a bit shorter, and have separate meetings for bigger issues that require discussion
* Adding more features without adding tests
* Putting too much effort into features that might not get implemented by the end

## New things
* Design tests earlier
* Add tests to build check in PR's
* Daily check ins

## Out of our control
* Studying for exams
* Course work getting heavier
* Preparing for after graduation
* Online only being more difficult to communicate
